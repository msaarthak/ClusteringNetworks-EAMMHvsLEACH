# ClusteringNetworks-EAMMHvsLEACH
This repository develops a system to perform a comparison between two energy efficient protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks(WSN) - EAMMH and LEACH. 

This project was done under the supervision of Dr.Hosam El-Ocla. His work can be found here: - http://flash.lakeheadu.ca/~hosam/

We used Matlab for this project and the code used was from this repository:- https://github.com/nishanthtgwda/Clustering-LEACHvsEAMMH

The final results for this project are shown in the file CNReport.pdf
